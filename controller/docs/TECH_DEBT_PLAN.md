# IIAB Controller — Technical Debt Register & Remediation Plan

> Consolidated, English-language successor to `controller/TECH_DEBT_AUDIT.md` (previously Spanish). Produced from four parallel line-level audits — UI/lifecycle, deploy/install, sync/ADB, and monitoring + build/infra. Scope: 34 Java files, ~11,707 LOC under `app/src/main/java/org/iiab/controller/`. Date: 2026-06-16. Repo status: proof-of-concept. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how the module works.

## Progress log

_Last updated: 2026-06-17. Tracks remediation work against the findings below. IDs map to the register in this file (F/D/S/M) and to `FORK_DELTA_ANALYSIS.md` (K)._

**Phase 0 — Guardrails: DONE** (PR `chore/phase0-guardrails`, merged as #4)
- Extracted `SystemStatsUtil` and added the first JVM unit tests (`SystemStatsUtilTest`, `SyncHandshakeHelperTest`); added unit-test infra (`returnDefaultValues` + real `org.json`). Addresses **M10**.
- CI gate: blocking `testDebugUnitTest`; `:app:lintDebug` runs non-blocking (scoped to `:app`). Addresses **M11**.
- Added a root `.gitignore` and `FORK_DELTA_ANALYSIS.md`.
- Remaining: flip lint `abortOnError=true` once the `:app` lint backlog is triaged; broaden tests to more pure functions (`LogManager.getFormattedSize`, `InstallationPlanner` sizing, the YAML parser).

**K1 — Fork delta (Termux ExtraKeys): DONE** (PR `feat/k1-extrakeys-in-app`, merged as #5; details in `FORK_DELTA_ANALYSIS.md`)
- **K1**: `loadIIABDefaultKeys()` moved out of upstream `ExtraKeysView` into app `IIABExtraKeys` (public APIs only). DONE.
- **K3**: layout is now a single-source-of-truth constant. DONE.
- **K4**: falls back to a minimal layout if the default fails to load. DONE.
- **K5**: unit test validating the layout grid (`IIABExtraKeysTest`). DONE.
- Remaining: point the submodule to `appdevforall/termux-app` at clean upstream and commit the pointer.

**Reference slice — Rootfs live sizes (Clean Architecture pilot): DONE** (PR #6, merged)
- First feature built across all three layers (`org.iiab.controller.rootfs.{domain,data,presentation}` + `util/ByteFormatter`); serves as the copy-paste template for future slices. See root `CLAUDE.md` (design map) and `ROOTFS_SIZE_PILOT_ANALYSIS.md`.
- Replaced the hardcoded `OS_*_GB` constants with live sizes from the Deploy server (`latest_*.meta4`), with per-ABI byte fallbacks for offline/error. Domain is pure JVM and unit-tested (`GetRootfsSizeUseCaseTest`, `ByteFormatterTest`).
- **Strangler step (DONE):** `DeployFragment`'s projection UI now consumes `RootfsViewModel` directly (observes live/fallback OS size) instead of going through `InstallationPlanner.resolveOsSizeGb()`. `InstallationPlanner.calculateProjectedSize` gained a `osSizeGb` overload so the OS-size resolution leaves the planner; the legacy overload (still resolving internally) is retained only for the non-UI install flow.
- **Offline UX (DONE):** addresses the "connectivity gating" watch item. `checkInternetAccess()` now stores a `hasInternet` flag; `updateDynamicButtons()` disables the install button (label "No connection") and the click listener shows a snackbar instead of starting a doomed download; an "Estimated sizes (offline)" caption shows whenever the size is a fallback (`RootfsUiState.live == false`); and offline we skip the live fetch (new `attemptLive` flag on the use case / ViewModel) to avoid the ~6 s timeout. The gauge itself was intentionally left untouched.
- Remaining (optional): later remove the legacy `resolveOsSizeGb` path once the install flow no longer needs it.

**Slice — Device architecture (`org.iiab.controller.deviceinfo`): DONE** (refactor-by-feature while fixing a dashboard bug)
- Bug: the dashboard "device architecture" field reported the *app's* ABI (via `nativeLibraryDir`), so a 32-bit build on a 64-bit device wrongly showed 32-bit (we install the 32-bit app on 64-bit hardware to test the 32-bit path).
- Fix: new layered slice — `domain` (`DeviceAbiProvider` port + `GetDeviceArchUseCase`, prefer-64-bit rule, pure JVM) and `data` (`BuildDeviceAbiProvider` reading device-level `Build.SUPPORTED_*_ABIS`). `DashboardFragment` now shows the real device arch; `getTermuxArch()` stays for app/content arch (modules, termux, debian). Unit test `GetDeviceArchUseCaseTest` covers the 32-bit-app-on-64-bit-device case.

**S1 — Sync credential injection (Phase 1 security): DONE** (PR `feat/phase1-security-sync-credential-validation`)
- Closes **S1**: QR-scanned sync credentials (host/port/user/pass) were interpolated into `rsyncd.conf` and the `rsync://` client URL unescaped, enabling config-directive and URL injection.
- New pure domain rule `org.iiab.controller.sync.domain.SyncCredentialValidator` (strict user/host charsets, port range, control-char-free password, `isSafeConfigValue` for config lines). Unit-tested (`SyncCredentialValidatorTest`) plus three new malicious-payload cases in `SyncHandshakeHelperTest`.
- Validation applied at the untrusted boundary (`SyncHandshakeHelper.parsePayload` -> `null` on invalid) and defensively in `RsyncManager` (server config + client URL paths), with a new `rsync_error_invalid_credentials` string (en + es). The validator is the reusable contract the remaining injection fixes (**S4**, **D2**) can build on.

**Phase 1 — Security hardening: IN PROGRESS.** **S1** done (above); remaining Phase 1 targets: **D2**, **D6**, **S3**, **M4**, **D12**, **S4**.

## 1. Executive summary

The Controller is functional and shows real security intent (it SHA256-audits native binaries at build time, scrubs the keystore in CI, and scopes most broadcasts). But it carries debt on four fronts that scale badly toward the README's "millions of users" goal:

1. **Security — most urgent.** Shell commands run **as root inside the container** from concatenated strings (command injection), with **no integrity verification** of multi-gigabyte downloads, over cleartext HTTP that can silently disable TLS validation. A compromised mirror or MITM can deliver a malicious rootfs that then executes as root. The ADB identity key is also mis-scoped, and an unscoped log broadcast leaks data to any installed app.
2. **Monolithic architecture.** Two God classes — `MainActivity` (2,209 LOC) and `DeployFragment` (2,754 LOC) — hold ~8 responsibilities each. Shared state lives in **public mutable fields on `MainActivity`** that fragments read/write directly, even from background threads.
3. **Ad-hoc concurrency.** ~30 raw `new Thread()` calls, no executor, no cancellation, no lifecycle awareness; callbacks touch `Activity`/`Context` after teardown; non-`volatile` flags race; process pipes risk deadlock.
4. **No safety net.** **Zero tests** despite JUnit/Espresso being declared; CI only runs `assembleDebug` with lint commented out and `abortOnError false`.

**Recommendation:** do **not** open with a massive rewrite. Phase 0 installs guardrails (tests + CI gate on pure logic), Phase 1 closes the security holes, and only then do Phases 2–4 attack concurrency and architecture with the net already in place.

## 2. Scoring method

Each item scores **Impact** (1–5, how much it slows the team), **Risk** (1–5, what happens if unfixed), and **Effort** (1–5, lower = easier). **Priority = (Impact + Risk) × (6 − Effort)** — higher is more urgent. IDs are prefixed by cluster: **F** = UI/lifecycle, **D** = deploy/install, **S** = sync/ADB, **M** = monitoring + build/infra.

## 4. Medium / lower-priority themes (Priority < 24)

Rather than list ~30 more rows, the remaining findings cluster into recurring themes; full line references live in the per-cluster audit notes.

**Concurrency & lifecycle (Prio 16–21):** dashboard spawns a new thread with N+1 blocking pings every 5 s (`M2`); deploy uses uncancelled handlers/threads guarded only by `isAdded()` (`D8`); a 7-flag implicit install state machine is race-prone (`D7`); `SyncFragment`/`RsyncManager` share unsynchronized process handles and start the daemon on the UI thread (`S10`); an unbounded `top -b -d 1` monitor thread never stops (`S17`).

**God classes & duplication (Prio 9–18):** `MainActivity` (`F1`) and `DeployFragment` (`D1`) are the structural root; `SyncFragment` is a third (`S14`). Download/extract pipelines (`D4`), `PRootEngine` exec paths (`D10`), and view-tree navigation by `getChildAt`/`performClick()` (`D15`) are duplicated/fragile.

**Hardcoding & magic values (Prio 12–20):** scattered URLs/ports/timeouts (`F10`), OTA version math (`F11`), inline hex colors (`S15`), undocumented `ppk_value` magic strings (`S16`).

**Rendering & memory (Prio 18–20):** gauges force `LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE` and animate at 60 fps on the main thread (`M6`); per-session 5,000-line scrollback grows RAM (`F25`); `AppListActivity` loads all packages + icons on the main thread with no view recycling (`F21`, `F22`); QR built pixel-by-pixel (`F23`).

**Build / infra / deprecation (Prio 7–20):** `abiFilters` contradicts the `splits` block (`M12`); build couples to network for native artifacts every `preBuild` (`M15`); `minifyEnabled false` on release; deprecated `onBackPressed`/`ListActivity` (`F20`); `DEBUG_ENABLED=true` shipped (`M19`); broad `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`/`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`/cleartext permissions (`M14`, `S18`).

**Documentation & dead code (Prio 5–16):** residual Spanish comments violating the English-only standard (`F16`, `D20`); dead `ServiceReceiver` with a null-action NPE (`M13`); duplicate one-liner methods (`D18`); `cacheDir` vs `filesDir` proot_tmp mismatch (`D21`); missing runbook for the manual Firebase/signing deploy and the `targetSdk 28` rationale (`M20`).

**Strategic (Prio 7, but blocking):** `targetSdk 28` (`M9`) keeps dangerous patterns "working" and blocks Play Store (requires 34+). High effort, but it gates the app's distribution future — track it as an epic, not a cleanup.

## 5. Phased remediation roadmap

The plan is designed to run **alongside feature work**, lowest-risk-first.

**Phase 0 — Guardrails (1 sprint).** Add JVM unit tests for the pure functions that have no Android deps — `parseMemLine`, `getDebianArch`, `evaluateSystemState`, log `maintenance` rotation, `getFormattedSize`, `InstallationPlanner` size math, `SyncHandshakeHelper` JSON parse, the YAML parser. Turn the CI lint gate back on (`abortOnError true`, uncomment `lintDebug`) and add a `testDebugUnitTest` step. This is the net everything else depends on (`M10`, `M11`).

**Phase 1 — Security hardening (1–2 sprints).** Close the injection and integrity holes that run as root: parameterize all shell invocations / validate-and-quote inputs (`D2`, `S1`, `S4`, `D11`); add mandatory SHA256 (and ideally signature) verification of every download before extract/exec, and fail closed if cacert is missing (`D6`); scope the log broadcast and remaining implicit broadcasts (`M4`); fix the ADB keystore key to sign/verify-only (`S3`); harden `ApkServer`/rsync secret handling (`D17`, `S11`); scope cleartext via a network-security-config instead of the global flag (`F15`, `S18`).

**Phase 2 — Concurrency & lifecycle stabilization (2–3 sprints).** Introduce a single shared executor + lifecycle-scoped cancellation; replace raw threads and convert recurring `Handler` loops to be torn down in `onDestroy`/`onPause` (`F4`, `M1`, `M7`, `D8`, `S8`, `M2`); make shared process handles `volatile`/synchronized and add `waitFor()` after `destroy()` (`D9`, `D19`, `S10`); drain process pipes and stop swallowing exec errors (`D12`, `S9`); replace `MODE_MULTI_PROCESS` with a real IPC/state mechanism (`F12`).

**Phase 3 — Architecture decomposition (ongoing, behind the net).** Extract config constants into a single `DeployConfig`/`Endpoints` class (`D3`, `F10`, `S7`). Introduce ViewModels + a thin repository layer so state leaves `MainActivity`'s public fields (`F8`, `M17`). Carve `DeployFragment` into download/extract/provision services and `MainActivity` into updater/terminal/server-controller collaborators (`D1`, `F1`, `S14`). De-duplicate the download and PRoot exec paths (`D4`, `D10`).

**Phase 4 — Build, distribution & polish.** Plan the `targetSdk 28 → 34+` epic (`M9`, `M3`) once Phases 1–2 remove the patterns that depend on the SDK exemption. Remove `jcenter()` (`M8`), align `abiFilters`/`splits` (`M12`), decouple native-artifact fetch from every build (`M15`), enable `minifyEnabled`, translate residual Spanish comments (`F16`, `D20`), delete dead code (`M13`, `D18`), and write the deploy runbook (`M20`).

## 6. Week-1 kickoff — start paying debt now

Begin field work immediately with this batch — all low-effort, high-signal, and safe to ship piecemeal:

1. **One-liners (a single PR):** scope `broadcastLog` with `setPackage()` (`M4`); add `removeCallbacks` in `DashboardFragment.onResume` (`M7`); delete both `jcenter()` lines (`M8`); add `onDestroy` removing the three `MainActivity` handlers (`F4`); wire `DEBUG_ENABLED` to `BuildConfig.DEBUG` (`M19`); add a `WAKE_LOCK` timeout (`M1`); declare or delete `TermuxCallbackReceiver` (`S13`); remove dead `ServiceReceiver` (`M13`).
2. **Keystore fix:** drop encrypt/decrypt + padding flags from the ADB key spec → sign/verify only (`S3`).
3. **CI gate:** uncomment `lintDebug`, set `abortOnError true`, add `testDebugUnitTest` (`M11`).
4. **First tests:** unit-test the pure functions listed in Phase 0 to seed the safety net (`M10`).
5. **Config extraction (start):** move scattered URLs/ports/versions into one constants class (`D3`, `S7`) — mechanical, unblocks later phases.

After this
